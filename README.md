# Portfolio Site

This is my first GitHub Pages project. ðŸš€  
The goal was to practice basic Git and GitHub workflows.

- How to use branches and pull requests  
- How to resolve merge conflicts and publish with GitHub Pages  

## Project Content
- A simple HTML page with a title and heading  
- An "About Me" section introducing myself  
- Changes to the title tag to simulate conflicts
